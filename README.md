# Python Machine Learning By Example Third Edition

This repository aims to solve the exercises of chapter 1 and 2 of the book **Python Machine Learning By Example Third Edition** as a micro project published by Mr. Ali HajiKhani.



**Chapter 1:** Getting Started with Machine Learning and Python

It is believed that in the next 30 years, artificial intelligence (AI) will outpace human
knowledge. Regardless of whether it will lead to job losses, analytical and machine
learning skills are becoming increasingly important. In fact, this point has been
emphasized by the most influential business leaders, including the Microsoft cofounder,
Bill Gates, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, and former Google executive chairman,
Eric Schmidt.

In this chapter, we will kick off our machine learning journey with the basic, yet
important, concepts of machine learning. We will start with what machine learning
is all about, why we need it, and its evolution over a few decades. We will then
discuss typical machine learning tasks and explore several essential techniques of
working with data and working with models.

At the end of the chapter, we will also set up the software for Python, the most
popular language for machine learning and data science, and its libraries and tools
that are required for this book.

We will go into detail on the following topics:

* The importance of machine learning
* The core of machine learning—generalizing with data
* Overfitting and underfitting
* The bias-variance trade-off
* Techniques to avoid overfitting
* Techniques for data preprocessing
* Techniques for feature engineering
* Techniques for model aggregation
* Setting up a Python environment
* Installing the main Python packages
* Introducing TensorFlow 2



**Chapter 2:** Building a Movie Recommendation Engine with Naïve Bayes 


As promised, in this chapter, we will kick off our supervised learning journey with
machine learning classification, and specifically, binary classification. The goal of
the chapter is to build a movie recommendation system. It is a good starting point to
learn classification from a real-life example—movie streaming service providers are
already doing this, and we can do the same. You will learn the fundamental concepts
of classification, including what it does and its various types and applications, with
a focus on solving a binary classification problem using a simple, yet powerful,
algorithm, Naïve Bayes. Finally, the chapter will demonstrate how to fine-tune
a model, which is an important skill that every data science or machine learning
practitioner should learn.

We will go into detail on the following topics:

* What is machine learning classification?
* Types of classification
* Applications of text classification
* The Naïve Bayes classifier
* The mechanics of Naïve Bayes
* Naïve Bayes implementations
* Building a movie recommender with Naïve Bayes
* Classification performance evaluation
* Cross-validation
* Tuning a classification model
