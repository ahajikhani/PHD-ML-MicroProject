# Python Machine Learning By Example Third Edition

This repository aims to solve the exercises of chapter 1 and 2 of the book **Python Machine Learning By Example Third Edition** as a micro project published by **Mr. Ali HajiKhani**.



**Chapter 1:** Getting Started with Machine Learning and Python

It is believed that in the next 30 years, artificial intelligence (AI) will outpace human
knowledge. Regardless of whether it will lead to job losses, analytical and machine
learning skills are becoming increasingly important. In fact, this point has been
emphasized by the most influential business leaders, including the Microsoft cofounder,
Bill Gates, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, and former Google executive chairman,
Eric Schmidt.

In this chapter, we will kick off our machine learning journey with the basic, yet
important, concepts of machine learning. We will start with what machine learning
is all about, why we need it, and its evolution over a few decades. We will then
discuss typical machine learning tasks and explore several essential techniques of
working with data and working with models.

At the end of the chapter, we will also set up the software for Python, the most
popular language for machine learning and data science, and its libraries and tools
that are required for this book.

We will go into detail on the following topics:

* The importance of machine learning
* The core of machine learning—generalizing with data
* Overfitting and underfitting
* The bias-variance trade-off
* Techniques to avoid overfitting
* Techniques for data preprocessing
* Techniques for feature engineering
* Techniques for model aggregation
* Setting up a Python environment
* Installing the main Python packages
* Introducing TensorFlow 2



**Chapter 2:** Building a Movie Recommendation Engine with Naïve Bayes 


As promised, in this chapter, we will kick off our supervised learning journey with
machine learning classification, and specifically, binary classification. The goal of
the chapter is to build a movie recommendation system. It is a good starting point to
learn classification from a real-life example—movie streaming service providers are
already doing this, and we can do the same. You will learn the fundamental concepts
of classification, including what it does and its various types and applications, with
a focus on solving a binary classification problem using a simple, yet powerful,
algorithm, Naïve Bayes. Finally, the chapter will demonstrate how to fine-tune
a model, which is an important skill that every data science or machine learning
practitioner should learn.

We will go into detail on the following topics:

* What is machine learning classification?
* Types of classification
* Applications of text classification
* The Naïve Bayes classifier
* The mechanics of Naïve Bayes
* Naïve Bayes implementations
* Building a movie recommender with Naïve Bayes
* Classification performance evaluation
* Cross-validation
* Tuning a classification model



## Using Datasets:


# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Neural-Networks
This project will focus on predicting heart disease using neural networks. Based on attributes such as blood pressure, cholestoral levels, heart rate, and other characteristic attributes, patients will be classified according to varying degrees of coronary artery disease. This project will utilize a dataset of 303 patients and distributed by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence is going to have a dramatic impact on the health field; as a result, familiarizing yourself with the data processing techniques appropriate for numerical health data and the most widely used algorithms for classification tasks is an incredibly valuable use of your time! In this tutorial, we will do exactly that.

We will be using some common Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Furthermore, for the machine learning side of this project, we will be using sklearn and keras. Import these libraries using the cell below to ensure you have them correctly installed.

<h3>The dataset is available through the University of California, Irvine Machine learning repository.</h3>
  Here is the URL:

http:////archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

This dataset contains patient data concerning heart disease diagnosis that was collected at several locations around the world. There are 76 attributes, including age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholestoral levels, echocardiogram data, exercise habits, and many others. To data, all published studies using this data focus on a subset of 14 attributes - so we will do the same. More specifically, we will use the data collected at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.

To import the necessary data, we will use pandas' built in read_csv() function.
